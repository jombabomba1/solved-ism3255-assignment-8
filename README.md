Similar to the last assignment, in this assignment, you will create FOUR classes:

<ul>

 <li>A MainClass</li>

 <li>A Parent (base) Class</li>

 <li>A Child class (subclass1)</li>

 <li>A second Child class (Subclass2)</li>

</ul>

As a group, choose any entity/concept expect the two examples below) that can be modeled as a Parent class and two different subclasses.

e.g.1: Student Example from the class lecture

<ul>

 <li>Parent: Student</li>

 <li>Child 1: Grad student</li>

 <li>Child 2 Undergrad student</li>

</ul>

e.g.2: Vehicle Example from ASG7

<ul>

 <li>Parent: Vehicle</li>

 <li>Child 1: Car</li>

 <li>Child 2: Plane</li>

</ul>

Define the parent and two subclasses for it as follow.

You <strong>Parent</strong> Class should have:

<ol>

 <li>One meaningful attribute which will be inherited by both children (e.g. attributes ID for student or color for vehicle)</li>

 <li>One parameterized constructor</li>

 <li>One meaningful method which is inherited by both children (e.g. Move() for vehicle)</li>

</ol>

Hint: don’t forget to compile and test your code before moving on.

<strong>Each</strong> <strong>child</strong> class should

<ul>

 <li>Inherits the parent’s attribute</li>

 <li>Has one specific attribute which is not included in the other child (e.g wingspan in plane class)</li>

 <li>Inherits and extends the parent’s constructor (see how we did it in your ASG7)</li>

 <li>Overrides the parent’s method to do a (slightly) different task as the parent’s method and the other child’s method (e.g. driving for a car and flying for a plane instead of moving for a vehicle)</li>

</ul>

Once you have designed your parent and children classes, write a MainClass with a main method. Your main method should:

Instantiate an object of each child class, call the method for each child object, and show the outputs. Hint: The outputs should be different since the overridden methods are different.

<h3><u>Instructions for Submission</u></h3>

<h3><u> </u></h3>

<h3>1.      Your main class should start with these two lines:</h3>

<h3>a.       //Group Number: &lt;your group number&gt;</h3>

<h3>b.      //PRESENT Members</h3>

<h3>2.      Save your main class as A8_yourGroupNumber.cs.</h3>

<h3>3.      Submit all FOUR classes that you created as attachments using the E-Learning Assignment tool.</h3>
